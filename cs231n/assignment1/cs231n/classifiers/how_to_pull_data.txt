The csv files are pulled from hive and original copies are stored in HDFS therefore,to view them, use
hdfs dfs -ls /user/ejlq/apm
To copy them locally to edge, use
hdfs dfs copyToLocal /user/ejlq/apm/grpby_stagt_dates.csv /san-data/usecases/agentpm/AgentProductionModel/datapull


grpby_stagt_dates2.csv has all the numeric columns grouped by geo_state,agent code, date effective and expiration date
the hive query is grpbyAgtStDates in my saved queries in hive, this file is huge and may take forever to load,maybe
need to query the file year by year, aggregate each years' data to each agent, then concate all 5 years data, when
renewing the model, just need to repeat the concate with the latest new year data.
